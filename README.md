# PawnsBoard

This is a two-player strategic board game where players take turns placing cards with numeric values and directional influence onto a grid. Each card contributes points to its row based on its value, and influences neighboring cells according to its directional arrows. The goal is to maximize your score by controlling high-value rows while tactically diminishing your opponentâ€™s cards through negative influence. The game ends when the board is filled, and the player with the highest total row score wins.
